UML .FRI
========

UML .FRI is new UML/DSM Case Tool written by perspective young authors from University Of Zilina, Slovakia. It was developed for educational purposes, but it is also ready for corporate usage.

So, what can this tool offer to me?

- Creation of own metamodel
- (In near future) Architekture client/server for working in teams
- (In near future) Adjustable code generation and reverse engineering
- Multiplatform GTK GUI (Tested under Windows XP and Linux)
and all of this under free GPL license

Who makes it works?
